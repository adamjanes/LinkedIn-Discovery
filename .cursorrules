# Cursor Rules

## Database Migrations

**IMPORTANT**: Before running any database migration commands (`npm run db:migrate up`, `npm run db:migrate down`, etc.), you MUST:

1. Create the migration file
2. Show the user what the migration will do
3. **Wait for explicit user approval** before executing any migration commands

This rule applies to ALL migration operations, including:
- Creating new tables
- Altering existing tables
- Seeding data
- Rolling back migrations
- Any other database migration operations

**Never run migrations automatically** - always wait for user confirmation first.
